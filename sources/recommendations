Heagarty Maths is interesting for several reasons:
1) A teacher started the project to help his pupils learn various topics.
2) He created lots of short single topic videos and made them available on YouTube
3) Various students (young people across the UK and beyond) posted on Twitter, etc to say thank you and confirm they found the materials useful.
4) Some of the pupils now create videos 
5) They use social media and online as the main conduits of information

A Beautiful Tree, James Tooley, (Julian Harty) gathers evidence of private schools globally and why parents choose to use them even when government funded schools are available locally. He also presented a peer teaching model that was used in India several centuries ago. The peer-teaching approach seems to be validated by various discussions including a Polish Academic living in Germany (met at ACM-CHANTS 2015), Julian's work in schools in Bangalore where pupils teach other pupils how to use the Windows 95 edition of Zoombinis, and discussions with Simon Adams (experienced head of pirmary schools in England).
