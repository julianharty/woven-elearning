\section{Assessment Classification}

From interviews with education experts one of the primary roles of an effective
teacher is to identify which students are in need of support to help them 
develop their understanding of a subject. 

In some studies teachers have been tracked via video camera to analyse their 
ability to anticipate the needs of the students. This feedback is then delivered
to the teacher to help them to become more aware of their approach.

As well as detection the teacher provides a crucial role in identifying the 
learning requirement.

To support these two activities a system could, through continuous assessment
of a students understanding analyse and support two functions beyond tracking
'correct' responses:

\begin{itemize}
\item Classify the types of 'error' in the responses from a student. The 
different responses can then be used to identify learning needs.
\item Provide a real time overview for a teacher of the 'time' needed by a student to complete an assessment exercise.
\end{itemize}

The goal being to understand responses beyond the correct one as a signal which
could be used as part of a machine learning solution using a 'trained' model 
of error classification and remedial exercises.
