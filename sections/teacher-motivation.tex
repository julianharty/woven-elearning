\section{Teacher Motivation}

Beyond the assumed impetus of a teacher to support their students in their 
development, in some contexts more thought may be needed into how teachers 
can be motivated.

There are enough anecdotal examples for us to generalise that large scale 
charity funded initiatives fail to live up to their potential due to limited
engagement. One cited reason for this is the need to engage 'gatekeepers' who
need significant motivation to deviate from the familiar and predictable 
incumbent approach. 

While it may not be possible to fully align an assessment system with the local
syllabus it should be apparent how any solution would aid in academic 
achievement. 

One option which was discussed was establishing a certificate around the usage and delivery of the system described above. This certificate would then, if 
recognised, aid the development of the teacher also.
